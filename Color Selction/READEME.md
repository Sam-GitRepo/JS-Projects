# Types of Variables

- Var
- Let
- Const

# Object

- How many ways to make an object in js

# [Hoisting](<(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-let-and-const-hoisting/)>)

Hoisting is a process in js where declaration is carry forwarded or move on top with respect to there scope.

- Hoisting is internally used in js such that each scope have an idea of there variables.

- In case of Hoisting only declaration is moved on top in the scope

# Diff between Let Var And Const

| let                                                                                                                            | var                                                           | const                                                                                                         |

| We can declare without init                                                                                                    | We can declare without init                                   | 'const' declarations must be initialized.                                                                     |
| We can change the init value                                                                                                   | We can change the init value                                  | We can not change the init value                                                                              |
| Scope of let is block Scope                                                                                                    | Scope of var is function level                                | Scope of let is block Scope                                                                                   |
| In Case of Let Hoisting Happens but internally js does not allow us to use a variable declared with let without initialization | We can init variable before declaration and it will work fine | case of const is same as let and in case of const we do not have the privilege to declare and init separately |
